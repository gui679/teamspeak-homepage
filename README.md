# TS webpage
This project works as a main webpage for a TS server.
All you need to do is download this project and create a config.ini based on config.ini.sample.

## Icons
copy content of the folder:
`[teamspeak_server_root]/files/virtualserver_1/internal/icons`

to the folder:
`[webserver_root]/assets/image/icons/`


## DEMO
It was originally created to my own personal TS server:
